## Vision
In a world of turmoil, we forget to take care of ourselves. With so much negativity bombarding us in day-to-day life, it can be hard to remember to love yourself and foster your own growth. This app, selfu, is designed to bring you back to your own sense of self-worth and value. selfu solves the problem of finding a direction in your daily journey of self-love and care. It will give you ideas and inspiration to take those steps yourself.
